# Image-segementation-using-U-Net-Architecture
In this repo, I have shared an Image segmentation notebook to classify water bodies from the satellite imagery dataset.

## **Description:**
A collection of water bodies images captured by the Sentinel-2 Satellite. Each image comes with a black and white mask where white represents water and black represents something else but water. The masks were generated by calculating the NWDI (Normalized Water Difference Index) which is frequently used to detect and measure vegetation in satellite images, but a greater threshold was used to detect water bodies.


## **ðŸ§­Problem Statement:** 
Segment the water bodies from satellite images

**U-net architecture:**

## **Steps taken to solve the problem:**

1. Load the satellite images data
2. Explore the image data
3. Pre-process the normalize the images
4. U-net architecture implementation
5. Train the model 
6. Evaluate and predict on the test dataset
